# Some useful functions in R


You can source these from here with something like this.  
*Remember to use the url to the raw version of the file:*

`source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cdevenish/R-Material/master/Functions/openGoo.r")`

Or if it doesn't work, with...
```
library(devtools)
source_url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cdevenish/R-Material/master/Functions/openGoo.r")
```
